GSessions v0.1 Alpha
--------- ---- -----

GSessions is under construction but it actually works and its tests run OK.

GSessions is an objects session manager. It's main application is to share through any medium (ie server/disk/networl) a complex object graph and be able to modify this model from diferent clients.

Client -> model -> Medium <- model <- Client

Clients can be implemented only in groovy currently.

The only available Mediums are:

1) A still very poor quality Node.JS Http key value Store.
2) A disk store.


Our immediate intentions are:

1) To build a JSessions to enable HTML5 clients.
2) To improove the Http Server Quality.
3) To add authorization for the resources.
4) To add version control for the objects.
